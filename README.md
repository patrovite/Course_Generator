## Status : Version 4.6 (stable)

## History
I created Course Generator in 2008 for my first 100 km ultra trail. Since then, I added a lot of features and it has been used by a lot of french ultra-runner. Up to the version 3.88 it has been written in C# and now java is used in order to be cross platform (Windows, Mac OS and Linux) and multilingual.

Course Generator is free (donation are welcome ;) ), multi platform (Windows, Mac and Linux), multi-language (currently English and French) and open source under GPL V3.

In order to works, Course Generator (also called CG) need a GPS file (GPX file) and some extra informations.

With Course Generator you can :

* Estimate your time at each point of the track.
* Set field type (the difficulty to the track: road, trail...) at each point of the track
* Set your fatigue coefficient and how it will evolve during the race
* Set the refueling time (to eat, to drink, to sleep...)
* Set the cut-off time on points of the track. CG will give you give an alert if you are late
* Set the recovery coefficient after a rest
* Set a name and a comment for each position of the track
* Take into account the effect of the night during
* Take into account the effect of the altitude (over 1500m)
* See your track on an OpenStreetMap map
* Generate a mini road book where you will see the track profile and all the most important information of your race (position name, time, hour, altitude, elevation gain...)
* Get statistics of your race
* Analyze a race
* Invert the track direction
* Define a new start point for a "looping track"
* Insert a track at the beginning or the end of another track
* Extract a part of the track
* Save all your specific settings in a CGX file (a Course Generator specific format)
* Have offline maps (OpenStreetMap)
* Use Metric or Imperial measure
* Display the speed as speed or pace
